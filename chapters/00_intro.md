# Introduction

Welcome! This book is meant to help you grow as a Computer Scientist, by exposing you to a broad range of topics. This book is for you if you know a bit about programming, but you have no clue how to put everything you know together to approach a new problem.

## Status

This is a very early work in progress. You shouldn't be reading this unless you would like to contribute. View the current version [here](http://github.justinmichaud.com/noclue/index.html). 

## Why?

There are many great resources that can take someone from knowing nothing about programming to having a basic understanding of a programming language (there are also a lot of terrible ones designed to part people with their money). There are also a large number of resources for people studying Mathematics and Computer Science in University. This book hopes to fill the gap between them. 

## Who am I?

I'm just a boring student from Canada. I will be entering my first year at the University of Waterloo in September 2016 to study Computer Science. I know how to program, but in the grand scheme of things, I am still just a beginner myself. This book is mostly about documenting my learning as I become a better Computer Scientist. 

So far, all of my Computer Science education has been self-taught. When you aren't exposed to more challenging material, it is easy to believe that you are a good programmer. The fact of life is that experience really is key, and you need to make sure that you gain many years of experience, not one year many times.

## How are the examples organized?

Each example is designed to be self-contained, and relevant to many different programming languages. The example solutions written by me will be mostly in Java, because that is the language I am most comfortable with. The examples will probably not be the best possible solution, so if you can improve them, please feel free to contribute.

## Let's Get Started!

With that out of the way, let's go!
