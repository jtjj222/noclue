## Example - Searching ##

Binary Search vs Linear Search

## Example - Sorting ##

Quicksort vs Insertion Sort

## Challenge ##

Can you think of a way to sort a deck of cards in time directly proportional to the number of cards (O(n))? Hint - As is often the case in Computer Science, you must trade one kind of performance for another. Think for a bit before looking at the solution.

## Solution ##

Radix sort

## Project ##

Brainfuck interpreter, describe turing completeness

## Takeaways ##

One of the most profound things that I've ever learned is the universal theory of computation. Programming languages change, new libraries and technologies gain traction, and new shiny hardware comes out, but the big ideas in Computer Science will always be the same. Until next time, Happy Coding!
